# Notebooks

`Jupyter` notebook environments have been used to facilitate explanation of the function and operation of the command-line Python programmes used.
These notebooks include explanatory text and snippets of code extracts to illustrate the code function, and thus not all code snippets included in the `Jupyter` environment are runnable.

A notebook has been written for each section of the [github repository](https://github.com/HobnobMancer/PhD_Project_Scripts). For clarity the repository section and accompanying notebook are identifable by labeling with the same number, such that `Section1_Extracting_Genomes` is described in detail within notebook `01_Downloading_Genbank_files.ipynb`.


[01_Downloading_GenBank_file](

Notebook for `Section1_Extracting_Genomes`, which contains the the Python script downloading GenBank files from the NCBI Assembly database.
