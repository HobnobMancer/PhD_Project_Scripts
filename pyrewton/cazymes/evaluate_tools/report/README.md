The Rnotebook provided in this directory contains the methods used to create the figures presented on the 2021 [Microbiology Society conference poster](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14370836.v1).

**But** more is being added to the Rnotebook. Currently, I am adding in an evaluation of the performance of the CAZyme prediction tools at the CAZy class level, so expect several updates over the next couple of weeks.

This Rnotebook can be used as a template for future evaluations.

If you have any recommendations about expanding the analysis of the performance of the CAZyme prediction tools, please do raise an issue in this repo!
