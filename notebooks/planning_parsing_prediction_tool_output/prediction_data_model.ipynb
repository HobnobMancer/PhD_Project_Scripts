    "# CAZyme prediction tool data models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the design of the data models for holding data retrieved from the CAZyme prediciton tools' outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To data retrieved from the CAZyme prediction tool output files is stored as a `CazymeProteinPrediction` class instance. These instances are stored in a dictionary keyed by the protein accession and valued by the respective `CazymeProteinPrediction` instance. This enables checking if data for a given protein has been retrieved from the output file, becuase CUPP and eCAMI can include the data for a given protein over multiple lines. This check faciltiates combining all data for a given protein into a single `CazymeProteinPrediction` instance to represent the query protein. Here, 'query protein' is the protein parsed by the CAZyme prediction tools to predict if the protein is a CAZyme and what CAZy (sub)families CAZy would catalogue the protein under.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the CAZyme prediction tools can predict that there are multiple CAZyme domains within a CAZyme. Each CAZyme domain is identified as a unique CAZy family that the CAZyme prediction tool has annotated the query protein with. For example, if the CAZyme prediction tool CUPP predicts the query protein A is annotated with the CAZy families GH15 and CBM32, this is interpretted that CUPP predicts protein A contains two CAZyme domains, one belong to the GH15 and the other to CBM32. This decision has been made becuase Hotpep, CUPP and eCAMI predict specific EC number predictions for each of the CAZy family annotations that they predict for a given CAZy family (or CAZyme domain). Additionally, HMMER, Hotpep and CUPP predict different domain ranges for each of the CAZy family annotations they predict for a protein. For example, CUPP may predict a domain range of 5-225 for GH15 and 275-389 for CBM32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each predicted CAZyme domain will be represented by a `CazymeDomain` class instance. Every `CazymeDomain` instance will have a:\n",
    "- `protein_accession` (str), the protein accession of the protein in which they are contained\n",
    "- `cazy_family` (str), the name of the CAZy family\n",
    "- `cazy_subfamily` (str), the name of the CAZy subfamily, if given, else the `cazy_subfamily` value will be set as a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unique `CazymeDomain` instance will be identfiable by its unique `cazy_family`-`cazy_subfamily` combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the `CazymeDomain` class has the attributes:\n",
    "- `ec_numbers` a list of strings, with each string containing a unique EC number\n",
    "- `domain_range`, a list of strings, with each stirng containing a unique domain range\n",
    "The `domain_range` attribute is set as a string    \n",
    "\n",
    "Both `ec_numbers` and `domain_ranges` are stored as lists becuase multiple EC numbers and domain ranges can be predicted for a single domain. Arguably, if a CAZy family is listed twice for a query protein, each with different domain ranges could indicate potentially different domains belonging to the same family. However, becuase the accuracy of domain range prediction has not been evaluated so it could be it is the same domain but the prediction tool has only identified two regions of it, and these two regions could still make a single CAZyme domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a CAZyme prediction tool does not predict EC numbers or domain range, these will be set to equal a null value in a list. This allows additional EC numbers or domain ranges to be added to the list of the CAZyme domain is listed again with a predicted EC number or domain range."
