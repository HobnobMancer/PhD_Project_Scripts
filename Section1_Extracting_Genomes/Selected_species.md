# Selected Species and reasoning for selection

This file contains a list of the species selected for assembly pull down from NCBI Assembly database, plus the reasoning behind their selection (incluidng referneces).

## General selection criteria

**Plant pathogens**
Evidence of microorganism being a plant pathogen in the literature. Reasoning: to be a plant pathogen the microorganism must be able to invade the host plant cells, and thus must be able to pass through the plant cell wall, indicative that the may do by expressing and secreting extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes (Chiapello _et al.,_ 2015; Kamoun _et al.,_ 2015)

**_Aspergillus_, _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillium_ species**
_Aspergillus_, _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillcium_ species have been previously well studied for their biomass degrading behaviours/phenotypes, including studies identifying specific extracellular plant cell wall degradaing enzymes that mediate this behaviour (Weinmann _et al.,_ 2013) - many of these species from these gensuses could be a good source of plant cell wall degrading enzymes.

**_Rhynomodosporium_ and _Madnapothe_ species**
_Rhynomodosporium_ and _Madnaporthe_ genuses contain many plant pathogens (**reference needed**), indicative of possing extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes.

Examination of the NCBI taxanomic database revealed that tese genuses along with _Aspergillus_, _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillcium_ share a common linieage (shown below), which may be indicative of common phenotypic behaviour (potentially)

## Fungal species

### _Trichoderma reesei_

One of the most used fungal species in industry. Well studied and utilised in industry for its enzyme-driven biomass degradation, speficically being shown to possess high lignocellulosic material degradation efficiency (Horta _et al.,_ 2018; Paula _et al.,_ 2018).

Additionally, the species has been shown to survive off a diverse range of biological substrates, numerous times, indicating a repitoir of enzymes that can target a diverse range of polysaccharides(Horta _et al.,_ 2018; Paula _et al.,_ 2018), thus increasing the potential of identifying cazymes from this species that can degrade one or multiple plant cell polysaccharides.

### _Trichoderma citrinovirde_, _Trichoderma harzianum_, _Trichoderma atrovidide_ and _Trichoderma pseduokoningii_

Demonstrated degradation of sawdust biomass (Kim _et al.,_ 2019) - sawdust from forestry industry can be used as feedstock for biofuel, thus demonstrating excellent potential for source of biocatalysts for biofuel production.

Kim _et al.,_ 2019: Tested using clearance zones in petri dishes, using different biolgoical substrates as carbon source. Tested for:

- beta-glucosidase
- avicelase
- CM-cellulase
- amylase
- pectinase
- xylanase

N = 1 for each test, thus cannot perform statilstical analysis to determine relative levels of degradation activity therefore, all four species selected as potential sources of plant cell wall degrading enzymes with good engineering potential.

**_T. citrinovidie_**
Biomass degrading xylanase from _T citrinovidie_ has also been used in chicken feed experiments induce biomass degradation to facilitate digestion of the feed by chickens (Lee _et al.,_ 2018) - indicates the ability to generate recombinant enzymes from _T. citronidie_ that can be used in isolation and not part of a large enzyme mix, and thus indicates suitabiltiy to for extracellular biofuel feedstock pre-treatment/sacchrification.

**_T. citrinovide_ and _T.harzianum_**
Shown to degrade mushrooms (Kim _et al.,_ 2016) - **_double check what the study found_**

### _Tricoderma koningii_, _Aspergillus niger_, _Aspergillus fumigatus_, _Phanerochaete chyrsosporium_ and _Lactobacillus plantarum_

**_double check that these are all fungi and they have assemblies available on NCBI_**
All four are shown to degrade the biomass dried distiller's grains, determining by measuring the increasing cellulose concentration after  (Howdeshell and Tanaka, 2018), indicative of plant cell wall degrading behaviour and thus extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzyme possession.
