# Selected Species and reasoning for selection

This file contains a list of the species selected for assembly pull down from NCBI Assembly database, plus the reasoning behind their selection (incluidng references).

## General selection criteria

> LP: An additional criterion to consider would be which species/isolates can we get material for. *Phytophthora* is a shoo-in, as are *Magnaporthe*/*Pyricularia* spp.

**Plant pathogens**
Evidence of microorganism being a plant pathogen in the literature. Reasoning: to be a plant pathogen the microorganism must be able to invade the host plant cells, and thus must be able to pass through the plant cell wall, indicative that the may do by expressing and secreting extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes (Chiapello _et al.,_ 2015; Kamoun _et al.,_ 2015)

> LP: in your draft thesis section, it would be useful to have a figure illustrating the typical ways in which fungi/oomycetes penetrate the plant, highlighting the points that PCWDEs would be useful.

Some species have been included in genomic analysis experiments to identity novel enzymes and annotate their respecitve genomes, especially those of the _Aspergillus_ genus, however, no studies examning the sequence/phenotype relationship, and especially no literature looking for a common basis with functional variation.

> LP: In the draft thesis section, definitely include references to the genome analyses. Maybe better to refer to an area being "underexplored" or "relatively underreported" than blankly stating "no literature" (which is easier to refute with a single reference)

**_Aspergillus_, _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillium_ species**
_Aspergillus_, _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillcium_ species have been previously well studied for their biomass degrading behaviours/phenotypes, including studies identifying specific extracellular plant cell wall degradaing enzymes that mediate this behaviour (Weinmann _et al.,_ 2013) - many of these species from these gensuses could be a good source of plant cell wall degrading enzymes.

_Trichoderma_ have been shown to utilise a diverse range of carbon sources, showing potential to degrade a range of plant cell wall polysaccharides, and are often used in biotechnological apllications owing to their ability to convert plant biomass into soluble sugars which are suitable for fermentation into biofuel (Kubicek and Druzhinina, 2013)
++ lack of genomic computational studies studying many _Trichoderma_ spp.

> LP: good initial summaries - a couple more references would be helpful in the draft thesis section

**_Rhynomodosporium_ and _Magnaporthe_ species**
_Rhynomodosporium_ and _Magnaporthe_ genuses contain many plant pathogens (**reference needed**), indicative of possing extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes.

> LP: Do you mean *Rhynchosporium* (as in the references)? I've not heard of *Rhynomodosporium*.

[King _et al.,_ 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797698/pdf/pone.0072536.pdf) - Rhynchosporium commune, R. agropyri and R. secalis are all closely related, thus good for homology study (reference from else where)

## Fungal species

### _Trichoderma reesei_

One of the most used fungal species in industry. Well studied and utilised in industry for its enzyme-driven biomass degradation, speficically being shown to possess high lignocellulosic material degradation efficiency (Kubicek and Druzhinina, 2013; Horta _et al.,_ 2018; Paula _et al.,_ 2018).

Additionally, the species has been shown to survive off a diverse range of biological substrates, numerous times, indicating a repertoire of enzymes that can target a diverse range of polysaccharides(Horta _et al.,_ 2018; Paula _et al.,_ 2018), thus increasing the potential of identifying cazymes from this species that can degrade one or multiple plant cell polysaccharides.

### _Trichoderma citrinovirde_, _Trichoderma harzianum_, _Trichoderma atrovidide_ and _Trichoderma pseduokoningii_

Demonstrated degradation of sawdust biomass (Kim _et al.,_ 2019) - sawdust from forestry industry can be used as feedstock for biofuel, thus demonstrating excellent potential for source of biocatalysts for biofuel production.

Kim _et al.,_ 2019: Tested using clearance zones in petri dishes, using different biolgoical substrates as carbon source. Tested for:

- beta-glucosidase
- avicelase
- CM-cellulase
- amylase
- pectinase
- xylanase

N = 1 for each test, thus cannot perform statilstical analysis to determine relative levels of degradation activity therefore, all four species selected as potential sources of plant cell wall degrading enzymes with good engineering potential.

> LP: My view is that the literature reference is justification enough. The "N=1" stuff isn't necessary.

**_T. citrinovidie_**
Biomass degrading xylanase from _T citrinovidie_ has also been used in chicken feed experiments induce biomass degradation to facilitate digestion of the feed by chickens (Lee _et al.,_ 2018) - indicates the ability to generate recombinant enzymes from _T. citronidie_ that can be used in isolation and not part of a large enzyme mix, and thus indicates suitability for extracellular biofuel feedstock pre-treatment/saccharification.

**_T. citrinovide_ and _T.harzianum_**
Shown to degrade mushrooms (Kim _et al.,_ 2016) - **_double check what the study found_**

**_T.harzianum_**
Kubicek and Druzhinina, 2013 - _T.harzianum_ are well studied for antifungal (mushroom) pest control, indicates secretion of extracellular Cazyme secretion.

Horta et al., 2018 - demonstrated extracellular cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosdiase activity of _Trichoderma harzianum_

[Li _et al.,_ 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852419312933) - specifically identified LZ117 extracellular cellulase and trialed successful in biomass degradation

**_Trichoderma atrovirdie_** Horta et al., 2018 - demonstrated extracellular cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosdiase activity of _Trichoderma atrovirdie_

### _Trichoderma asperellum_

[Wang _et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717319150) - Demonstrated high cellulase, CMCase, FPase and beta-glucosidase activity of _T.asperellum_ T1 strain, and showed ability of T1 to ferment biomass without pretreatment - indicates can breadkown biomass material efficiently - also if can already ferment would facilitate co-/simultaneous sacchrification and fermetnation which is the direction industry wants to move into to increase economic efficienty of biofuel production process.

[Wang _et al.,_ 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119237) - earlier work of the Wang _et al.,_ 2017 paper showing high efficiency of T1 to degrade lignocellulisic biomass.

### _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (anamorph: _Pyricularia oryzae_) and _Magnaporthe grisea_ (anamorph: _Pyricularia grisea_)

**Note:** for this species use its anamorph name for NCBI, although NCBI does seem to autmatically correct for this, then still note that a different name will appear instead of '_Magnaporthe oryzae_'

[_Magnaporthe grisea_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575082)
[_Magnaporthe oryzae_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30022707)

> LP: Ah - I see you're handling the nomenclature issue, here. That's good - see the note in the species list, and use *Pyricularia* in there.

Similarly, MG05 and MG08 were isolated from infected leaf tissues of foxtail millet and MG07 from buffel grass (Cenchrus celiaris L.)." - basically "Blast disease caused by the Magnaporthe species is a major factor affecting the productivity of rice, wheat and millets" so they took isolates of _Magnaporthe_ species and analysed their genomes, and these are MG03, MG05, MG07, MG08 and MG12 becuase they were shown to be plant pathogens.
